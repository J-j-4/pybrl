TODO:
(n-8) Probably a bug that doesn't capitalize letters if a foreign language is detected. (check for other indicators as well)

(n-7) Implement a Page-matrix which will show the relative position of translated braille. See hypercomplex fraction on the link on (n-6)

(n-6) Check whether double indicators are needed: http://www.brailleauthority.org/formats/2011manual-web/formats05.html

(n-5) support for mixed numbers in Nemeth           (Find out a way... - One might be to have a number just before the fraction, but it isn't always true)

(n-4) mathml2variable population                    (Might not be needed. Probably last thing to add.)

(n-3) Implement the Nemeth Code and the Universal math system

(n-2) Better detection of mathematics in detectLanguage     (If Math is detected, then use the English Characters for language, and the Greek within the Nemeth code - Not from the Language File)

(n-1) Add more english in the language files (See Bookmarks)


NOTES:
1- Do the conversion of the math variables before the specialCharacter variables
2- Each time, set the indicators within the math module so that we know the language we are at.
3- Funny stuff happen to MathML conversion of this expression: 1/(2/a_b) (Which is why the `asciimathml` dependency will be dropped)
