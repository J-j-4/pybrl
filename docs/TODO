NOTES:
1- Do the conversion of the math variables before
2- Each time, set the indicators within the math module so that we know the language we are at.
3- Funny stuff happen to MathML conversion of this expression: 1/(2/a_b)

TODO:
(n-5) support for mixed numbers in Nemeth           (Find out a way... - One might be to have a number just before the fraction, but it isn't always true)

(n-4) mathml2variable population                    (Might not be needed. Probably last thing to add.)

(n-3) Implement the Nemeth Code and the Universal math system

(n-2) Better detection of mathematics in detectLanguage     (If Math is detected, then use the English Characters for language, and the Greek within the Nemeth code - Not from the Language File)

(n-1) Add more english and greek symbols in the language files (See Bookmarks)



(n) setup.py
    - Depends on: asciimathml
