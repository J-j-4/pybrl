NOTES:
1- Do the conversion of the math variables before
2- Each time, set the indicators within the math module so that we know the language we are at.
3- Funny stuff happen to MathML conversion of this expression: 1/(2/a_b)

TODO:
1) mathml2variable population

2) Implement the Nemeth Code and the Universal math system

2) Better detection of mathematics in detectLanguage

2) Add more english and greek symbols in the language files

3) setup.py
    - Depends on: asciimathml
